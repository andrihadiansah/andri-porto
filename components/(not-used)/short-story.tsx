          In early 2022, I made several job applications to many companies in
          Indonesia, but unfortunately, there were no opportunities for me to
          grow after graduation. This was due to many companies downsizing their
          workforce because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

          Throughout the journey of 2022, I struggled to meet the needs of my
          family by engaging in small-scale businesses with my wife. Eventually,
          And I decided to immerse myself in technology up to the present, as
          the digitalization era is rapidly advancing. I believe this presents
          an opportunity for my personal growth, leveraging the multitude of
          access available in today's era.

          In mid-2022, I developed a renewed interest in relearning web
          development. While at university, my studies mainly focused on
          understanding the fundamentals of human-computer interaction and
          communication. However, during this time, a strong desire grew within
          me to explore this field more extensively. Taking matters into my own
          hands, I pursued my interest by watching YouTube tutorials, reading
          documents on websites, and delving into various other sources. This
          pursuit continues to the present moment
